Bank Managemet System

In this project I am going to implement a Bank Management system from which users can manage their accounts. 
There are two types of users, Customers and Administrators. Both are presented with their own menus (after login of course). 
Customers can use the system to withdraw cash, transfer cash from one account to another, deposit cash and get their current balance. 
Administrators can create, delete, view and update accounts of different users. 
They must also be able to view certain reports about users and accounts.
